        overview:
            'This was a take-home technical challenge for a position at Apropos, a job platform using algorithmic matching. The goal was to redesign the match visualization component to help users better understand how matches are calculated and what actions to take based on the results. ',

        challenge:
            'The main challenge was the lack of clarity in how match scores were presented. The initial design used percentage bars, but users found them confusing. The brief asked to improve match understanding, highlight alignment areas, and clarify next steps, within an estimated 4-hour delivery window.',

        goals:
            'Design a better way to present match information in the company (job seeker) view. Implement a functioning prototype and deliver a short presentation explaining the rationale.',

        research:
            'Due to time constraints (4hours total), no in-depth user interviews or benchmarking were required. However, I reviewed similar job platforms and analyzed the provided JSON data structure to guide the visualization design.',

        approach:
            'I structured the solution in three user flows (Job Seeker, Recruiter, Invited Candidate) and focused on visual hierarchy, scannability, and interactivity. I used tooltip explanations, tag filters, and interaction feedback to improve usability.',

        wireframes:
            'I created both hand-drawn and digital wireframes to plan the match card redesign, focusing on grouping information meaningfully and simplifying complexity.',

        finalDesign:
            'The final prototype includes an interactive match card component with personality bars, tag filters, explanation tooltips, and annotations. The design is modular and easily extendable.',

        finalScreens: [
            '/assets/apropos-cards-1.png',
            '/assets/apropos-cards-2.png'
        ],

        outcome:
            'Although this project was not selected for the final position, it allowed me to practice rapid prototyping, storytelling under time pressure, and reflect on how to communicate design intent more clearly. The process was valuable in surfacing areas for growth in strategic framing and presentation delivery.',
        
        outcomePdf:'/assets/docs/apropos-presentation_compressed.pdf',

        learnings:
            'I learned to ask more targeted questions early in the process instead of assuming constraints. I also realized the importance of aligning deliverables with not only explicit, but also implicit expectations, and of making strategic reasoning more visible within UX decisions.'
