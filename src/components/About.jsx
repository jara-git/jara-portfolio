            <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                I believe in designing experiences that not only look good but also serve a purpose.
                My approach combines empathy, strategy, and creativity to craft meaningful and usable interfaces.
                At linia, we don’t believe design is the product.
                We believe design is what makes the product speak, work, and belong.

                We design to connect — people with spaces, ideas with forms, function with meaning.
                We think of design not as decoration, but as a quiet force:
                it guides, reveals, simplifies.

                Design isn’t about imposing style.
                It’s about listening, distilling, and giving shape to something that was already there — waiting to become real.

                We move between the digital and the physical, between the visual and the spatial.
                We work with clarity and intention, but always leave room for beauty and intuition.

                In a world shaped by speed, noise, and automation,
                we choose to design with presence, precision, and purpose.
